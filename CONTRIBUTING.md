## Keep with the Coding Style

By looking into the code you see the (hopefully) very consistent code-styling.
Each type of code/file has it's typical naming-conventions, spaces, lines, ...

* KISS: Keep It Small and Simple
* Code speaks: Clean readable code preferred over all-too-many comments. 

Please read our [Coding Guidelines](coding-style.md)


## Our Way of Developing

I am a newbie at GitHub. I want to learn how to use GitHub to host code, to 
track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Maybe using GitHub Flow would be a good idea?!

Help me/us get the project well done at GitHub with all the great stuff GitHub
has to offer. Thank You for sharing your knowledge!
