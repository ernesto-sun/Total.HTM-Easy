This folder has the simple purpose to be copied over 'as is'. 

That means, all images put in here, with or without sub-folders,
are taken as is, regardless of being even used and without any
modifications such as resize, compression etc. thats made 
on images usually. 

Note: MAKE usually does this:

* Only take the /image/ if it used within HTML or CSS somewhere
* Resize it to a maximum of 800*800 by default, keeping ratio
* Store a bigger version with the filename-ending .b.jpg
