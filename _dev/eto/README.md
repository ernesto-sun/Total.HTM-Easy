#                    DEV-zone of Ernesto Sun (eto)

## WHY

This is an idea, to have my personal TODO-lists and maybe other dev-docs like 
engineers-dairy here within the project files. This way my local development 
is at Git, but also fully available offline. 

Please tell me the better way, I still have little to no experience with Git!
